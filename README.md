Home Automation with Raspberry Pi Pico W ?

?(Bluetooth)?

Overview

This project enables home automation using Raspberry Pi Pico W with built-in Bluetooth. The ?

system allows wireless control of GPIO pins via a Serial Bluetooth Terminal on an Android ?

phone.?

Features

*	Wireless control of GPIO pins using Bluetooth commands.?

*	Simple and efficient communication via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).?

*	Easy setup using Thonny IDE.?

Requirements

Hardware

*	Raspberry Pi Pico W

*	Android phone with Serial Bluetooth Terminal app

*	Any external devices to control via GPIO (LEDs, relays, etc.)?

Software

*	Thonny IDE (to flash Python scripts onto Pico W)?

*	Serial Bluetooth Terminal (available on the Play Store)?

Setup Instructions

?1.?	Prepare Raspberry Pi Pico W:?

o	Connect Pico W to your PC via USB.?

o	Open Thonny IDE and ensure Pico W is detected.?

?2.?	Upload Python Scripts:?

o	Upload the following files to the Pico W using Thonny: ?

?	ble_advertising.py

?	ble_simple_peripheral.py

?	main.py

o	Restart Pico W after flashing the scripts.?

?3.?	Install Bluetooth Terminal on Android:?

o	Download Serial Bluetooth Terminal from the Play Store.?

o	Open the app and connect to the Pico W Bluetooth device.?

?4.?	Control GPIO Pins via Bluetooth:?

o	Send "Toggel_GP2" to toggle GP2 pin.?

o	Send "NO_GP2" to turn GP2 OFF.?

o	Use similar commands for other GPIO pins.?

Commands Reference

Command

Action

Toggel_GP2?
